A little script I wrote to generate some simple statistics based on a list of integers.

## Disclaimer

I am not a trained statistician so the explanation of the statistics in the script may not be accurate. If you see something that looks incorrect or could be explained better, please please please fork the script, fix it and send me a pull request.

I put this script up because I hope it can help some folks get some numbers that are easy to understand and begin to gain an interest in statistics and analyis.
